            Transformers are iconic robots known for their 
            ability to transform between different forms They 
            typically shift from humanoid robots to vehicles like cars, trucks, or planes. <br>
            These characters are split into the Autobots, who are the heroes, and the Decepticons, who are the villains. The concept of Transformers first emerged in the 1980s with a toy line created by Hasbro, which quickly led to an animated TV series and comic books.
            Each Transformer has a unique personality, abilities, and transformation,
            making them distinct and memorable.
