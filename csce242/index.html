                                    This assignment requires students
                                    to create a webpage
                                    featuring an `index.html` with an associated stylesheet.
                                    The page must include a header, subheader, at least two paragraphs,
                                    two formatted images, and a table with specific dimensions.
                                    Additionally, a consistent color theme, style within the navigation,
                                    and images with borders and padding are all required by using all three CSS techniques (element, ID, class)
                                    to ensure the page is visually appealing and well-structured.

                                    This third assignment is meant to give students a better
                                    understanding of the way that the
                                    div's and flexboxes do. Students are tasked to replicate
                                    another website by using these techniques
                                    to display the information in the same style.
