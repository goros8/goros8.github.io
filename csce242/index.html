                                    This assignments goal was to have
                                    students correctly set up a github
                                    repository and clone that repository
                                    in there IDE. This assignment also 
                                    required the students to be able to 
                                    develop a basic website using fundamental
                                    HTML properties that we went over in class
                                </p>

                                    This assignment requires students
                                    to create a webpage
                                    featuring an `index.html` with an associated stylesheet.
                                    The page must include a header, subheader, at least two paragraphs,
                                    two formatted images, and a table with specific dimensions.
                                    Additionally, a consistent color theme, style within the navigation,
                                    and images with borders and padding are all required by using all three CSS techniques (element, ID, class)
                                    to ensure the page is visually appealing and well-structured.
                                </p>

                                    This third assignment is meant to give students a better
                                    understanding of the way that the
                                    div's and flexboxes do. Students are tasked to replicate
                                    another website by using these techniques
                                    to display the information in the same style.

                                    For this assignment we had to observe a UofSc
                                    webpage and recreate this page on our own.
                                    All of the elements and divs also had to react
                                    appropriately when converged onto smaller screens.

                                    had to be able to demonstrate our understanding
                                    of how script.js files are able to alter what we
                                    see on the index.html page.

                                    This project was the beggining of a much larger project that will be continuing throughout the
                                    semester. This starting point was to allow us to start to get a general idea about what kind of
                                    website we would like to create and what it is going to be about.

                                    This assignment was the second part of the overall class project. This part was meant to
                                    have the students envision how there website was going to be layed out and what kind of
                                    functionality it would have when certain button or objects are interacted with.

                                For this part of the project we got the Framework
                                for the html and css established. This will be good groundwork
                                going forward with the project and will allow Us
                                to be able to build off of it and bring our visions to the webpage.
